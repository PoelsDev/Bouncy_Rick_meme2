Bouncy Rick is back with an upgraded background. Keep the size()-method at 1280 x 720 for the background to work. Startup could take some time, don't worry. Just wait.
You'll have to install the needed libraries aswell, video &amp; sound. If you're getting asked to move the .pde file to a library, click "OK" and move the data folder in that newly made library.
